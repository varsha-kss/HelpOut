## Technologies used
Flutter and Firebase has been used to make our project. 

Flutter is mobile app development framework that allows to build cross-platform apps for android,ios and web using single codebase. By using framework we were able to make an visually appealing and responsive user-interface.

Firebase is a platform where real-time database storage, authentication and analytics is done.This helps our app to improve and grow. We have used this to handle user authentication and to store data of all the orphanages,old-age homes and NGOs.
